# SALAMA1D

## Overview
**SALAMA 1D** is a deep neural network model designed to infer the probability of thunderstorm occurrence from the vertical profiles of ten atmospheric fields from numerical weather prediction (NWP). It has been trained using
- operational forecasts of the ICON-D2-EPS weather model, provided by [Deutscher Wetterdienst](https://www.dwd.de/)
- lightning observations of the LINET lightning detection network, provided by [nowcast GmbH](https://www.nowcast.de/)

The scientific background is detailed in the following paper:
K. Vahid Yousefnia et al.: _Inferring Thunderstorm Occurrence from Vertical Profiles of Convection-Permitting Simulations: Physical Insights from a Physical Deep Learning Model_, 2024. (Submitted to _Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems_, preprint available at: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20087)

The datasets used for training, validation, and testing are available from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13981208.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981208).

This repository provides the relevant code to use SALAMA 1D. In addition, we provide the code for SALAMA 0D, which uses single-level fields instead of vertical profiles is used as a benchmark in the above-mentioned paper.

Fun fact: The acronym stands for **S**ignature-based **A**pproach of identifying **L**ightning **A**ctivity using **Ma**chine learning and means "lightning" in Finnish.
